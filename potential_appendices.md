# Potential appendices

Everyone taking this class for credit will be responsible for producing an appendix to the notes on a suggested topic or topic of their choosing.

- For a sense of what I'm looking for, check out [the appendices in these notes](https://tbrazel.github.io/assets/coursenotes/motivic.pdf)
- To call dibs on anything, just submit a [pr](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and edit this page to put your name next to it.
- Below I'll include a brief overview of each project, as well as a very rough indication of how difficult I expect it to be or any background that may be needed.


## Inoue surfaces
Provide an overview of the construction and basic properties of *Inoue surfaces*, which are examples of complex surfaces with no divisors.

## Sheaf cohomology and singular cohomology
Give a recount of the comparison theorem between singular cohomology and sheaf cohomology with coefficients in a constant sheaf. Explain (following Sella) why we only need to assume $X$ is semi-locally contractible in the assumptions of the theorem.

## $\Omega_3=0$
Give an overview of Rokhlin's result that the cobordism group of oriented 3-manifolds is trivial.

## The $\widehat{A}$-genus
Discuss the $\widehat{A}$-genus and its connection to spin bordism. (Dibs: Zoe Batterman)

## The Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence
Explain the spectral sequence $H^p(X,\Omega^q) \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(X,\mathbb{C})$ valid for complex manifolds, following Deligne, Fröhlicher, and others. Explain why it degenerates for compact Kähler manifolds, and give examples of the failure of degeneration in other settings.
