# Potential appendices

Everyone taking this class for credit will be responsible for producing an appendix to the notes on a suggested topic or topic of their choosing.

- For a sense of what I'm looking for, check out [the appendices in these notes](https://tbrazel.github.io/assets/coursenotes/motivic.pdf)
- To call dibs on anything, just submit a [pr](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and edit this page to put your name next to it.
- Below I'll include a brief overview of each project, as well as a very rough indication of how difficult I expect it to be or any background that may be needed.

## Inoue surfaces
Provide an overview of the construction and basic properties of *Inoue surfaces*, which are examples of complex surfaces with no divisors.

## Sheaf cohomology and singular cohomology
Give a recount of the comparison theorem between singular cohomology and sheaf cohomology with coefficients in a constant sheaf. Explain (following Sella) why we only need to assume $X$ is semi-locally contractible in the assumptions of the theorem.

## $\Omega_3=0$
Prove that $\Omega_3^\text{SO}=0$ following Chapter 2 of Saveliev's *Lectures on the topology of 3-manifolds*. (Dibs: Luke Lelli)

## The $\widehat{A}$-genus
Discuss the $\widehat{A}$-genus and its connection to spin bordism. (Dibs: Zoe Batterman)

## The Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence
Explain the spectral sequence $H^p(X,\Omega^q) \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(X,\mathbb{C})$ valid for complex manifolds, following Deligne, Fröhlicher, and others. Explain why it degenerates for compact Kähler manifolds, and give examples of the failure of degeneration in other settings.

## Calabi-Eckmann manifolds
Give an intro to Calabi-Eckmann manifolds, following their original paper. Prove that Calabi-Eckmann manifolds do not admit a Kähler metric and therefore are not algebraic, and explain why this is so cool! Time/interest pending, investigate their $\overline{\partial}$ cohomology, following Kodaira-Spencer and Ise, discussed in Appendix II.9 in Hirzebruch.

## The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem via Morse theory
Give an overview of Andreotti and Frankel proof of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem via Morse theory. Use it to compute the (co)homology of various complex algebraic varieties.

## Thom's computation of $\pi_\ast \text{MSO}$
Prove Theorem 7.2.2 in Hirzebruch, that $\Omega_k^{\text{SO}}$ is finite for $k\not\equiv0\pmod{4}$ and that $\Omega_{4n}^{\text{SO}} = \mathbb{Z}^{\\#\text{partitions of }n} \oplus \text{finite gp}$, following Thom's 1954 paper. This involves some heavier homotopy theory than other projects.
